Segments in this group import or collect flows and provide them to all following
segments. As all other segments do, these still forward incoming flows to the next
segment, i.e. multiple input segments can be used in sequence to add to a single
pipeline.

If you are connected behind [BelWÃ¼](https://www.belwue.de) contact one of our developers
or the [bwNet project](bwnet.belwue.de) for access to our central Kafka cluster. We'll
gladly create a topic for your university if it doesn't exist already and provide you
with the proper configuration to use this segment.

If the person responsible at university agrees, we will pre-fill this topic with flows
sent or received by your university as seen on our upstream border interfaces. This can
be limited according to the data protection requirements set forth by the universities.
